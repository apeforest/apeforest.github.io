About eight months ago, I made a big career transition from semiconductor industry to online advertising tech industry. 

Here are the reasons that made my move:

First of all, the semiconductor industry is shrinking. Although semiconductor chips are in increasing demand and used everywhere in our daily life, we had to admit the dynamics are diminishing. There are very few, if not none, startups in semiconductor in the past ten years. Even some of the big guys are either acquired by another giant or merged with some other semiconductor brand to compete against the supersized companies, such as Intel and Qualcomm etc. Whereas, ad tech industry is just like semiconductor industry 20 or 30 years ago. There are hundreds or thousands of small companies in the pool and many more are emerging day by day. It means more fiece competition but also more opportunity.

Second, at the end of day, I am still writing code, which I enjoy. It's only the matter of switching from one language to another. In semiconductor industry, it's already mostly coding based: designers write chip function description using Verilog/VHDL; CAD engineers or EDA tool developers write the gate placement and routing algorithm using C/C++. There are still differences. In semiconductor companies, the software is mostly based on single server architecture. A program is a single binary which performs the entire execution from parsing input file, to build circuit models, to the actual circut implementation and optimization. In ad tech industry, or internet companies as a whole, it's a service oriented architecture (SOA). It may require some change in software architecture, but it seems to me the latter has a much better scalability.

Third, data is the king. In the future, data and how to proceess the data becomes a crucial skill. Although chip design per se is a big data processing work (billions of transistors on a chip), it is by far much less than the data in ad tech comopanies. As a result, the market in ad tech industry is much larger than that in semiconductor.

I am happy I made the move and I encourage my fellow semicondutor peers to also try setting foot in this new field. It may be a bumpy ride, but definitely more fun ahead :)
